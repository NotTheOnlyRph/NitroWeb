            <p>If you are visiting this page, that's probably because you paid for a cartridge of <i>New Mini SMB</i><sup>(1)</sup>. If this is the case, you got scammed.
            <br><br>New Super Mario Bros. mods are made <b>with no profit in mind</b>.<br>Therefore, <b>they must not be sold in any form.</b>
            <br><br>People that sell these cartridges just downloaded the mod on <a href="https://www.nsmbcentral.net/mods/">NSMB Central</a> or on <a href="https://nsmbhd.net/forum/12-nsmb-hacks/">The NSMB Hacking Domain</a> and put them in a cartridge.
            <br>They are making money over Nintendo, the mod's developer and you.
            
            <h2>What should I do if I got scammed?</h2>
            
            First, tell us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/x7gr3M9">NSMB Central Discord server</a><sup>(2)</sup> that you have been scammed and send us the link<sup>(3)</sup>. We'll contact the mod's developer and nuke the page.
            <br><br>Then, report them to the seller's payment processor (often ClickBank, Plimus, or PayPal) and demand your money back.
            <br>Keep in mind that this kind of sale is illegal (selling our free software is a violation of copyright) and also fraudulent. If the payment processor refuses to issue a refund, contact your credit card company and request a chargeback.
            
            <h2>If these cartridges are illegal, how can I play the mod?</h2>
            
            Super easy! You'll need to buy a ds flashcard (like an R4), and <a href="https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/installing-flashcard">install TwilightMenu++ on it.</a>
            <br>You'll also need to have a USA ROM of <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i><sup>(4)</sup>.
            <br>Then, search for mods on <a href="https://www.nsmbcentral.net/mods/">NSMB Central</a> or on <a href="https://nsmbhd.net/forum/12-nsmb-hacks/">The NSMB Hacking Domain</a>.
            <br>These mods are in .xdelta format. Click <a href="https://nsmbhd.net/thread/2382-how-to-import-export-xdelta-patches-tutorial/">here</a> if you don't know how to patch them.
            <br>Once it's done, copy the patched ROM somewhere on your flashcard's micro SD card<sup>(5)</sup>, and enjoy!

            <br><sup>(2)</sup> You can join the server as a guest, without having a Discord account.
            <br><sup>(3)</sup> Please mention me by adding "@Rph" to your message.
            <br><sup>(4)</sup> Ask on the Discord if you have any question.
            <br><sup>(5)</sup> TwilightMenu++ developers recommend putting the files in a "nds" folder.
